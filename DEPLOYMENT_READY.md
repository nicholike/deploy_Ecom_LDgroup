## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Method 1: One-Command Auto-Deploy (Recommended)

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in to Railway
railway login

# Run the automation script
./deploy-railway.sh
```

The script will prompt you for:
- Project name (default: mlm-ecommerce-backend)
- SePay API key
- Bank account details
- Virtual account number

Everything else is automated! ✨

### Method 2: Manual Deploy

See **[DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md)** for step-by-step manual instructions.

## 📋 What the Automation Does

1. ✅ **Prerequisites Check**
   - Verifies Railway CLI is installed
   - Checks if logged in to Railway
   - Verifies Git repository

2. ✅ **Security Setup**
   - Generates cryptographically secure JWT secrets (32 bytes)
   - Creates unique JWT_SECRET and JWT_REFRESH_SECRET

3. ✅ **Railway Project**
   - Creates new Railway project with your chosen name
   - Links to your GitHub repository

4. ✅ **Database Setup**
   - Adds MySQL database service
   - Railway auto-injects DATABASE_URL

5. ✅ **Environment Configuration**
   - Sets 20+ environment variables
   - Configures production settings
   - Sets up payment integration (SePay)
   - Configures commission rates

6. ✅ **Code Deployment**
   - Commits and pushes code changes
   - Deploys to Railway
   - Monitors deployment status

7. ✅ **Post-Deploy Info**
   - Provides backend URL
   - Shows next steps
   - Gives useful commands

---

## 🔍 Verify Deployment

After deployment completes, run:

```bash
./verify-deployment.sh
```

Enter your Railway backend URL when prompted.

The script will test:
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Database connection
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Authentication enforcement
- ✅ SePay webhook security
- ✅ Application readiness

---

## 📊 Environment Variables (Auto-Configured)

The automation script sets these variables:

### Application
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
API_PREFIX=/api/v1
```

### Security (Auto-Generated)
```bash
JWT_SECRET=<auto-generated-32-bytes>
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<auto-generated-32-bytes>
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_TTL=60
RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100
```

### Payment (From Your Input)
```bash
SEPAY_API_KEY=<your-key>
BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=<your-account>
BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME=<your-name>
BANK_CODE=<your-bank>
SEPAY_VA_NUMBER=<your-va>
SEPAY_VA_ACCOUNT_NAME=<your-va-name>
```

### Commission Rates
```bash
DEFAULT_COMMISSION_RATE_F1=10
DEFAULT_COMMISSION_RATE_F2=4
DEFAULT_COMMISSION_RATE_F3=2
DEFAULT_COMMISSION_RATE_F4=0
```

### Database
```bash
DATABASE_URL=<auto-injected-by-railway>
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

### 1. Get Your Backend URL

```bash
railway domain
```

Save this URL: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app`

### 2. Update CORS (After Deploying Frontend)

```bash
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN="https://your-frontend.vercel.app,https://your-backend.up.railway.app"
```

### 3. Configure SePay Webhook

Go to: https://my.sepay.vn

**Settings → Webhook:**
- URL: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app/api/v1/payment/sepay-webhook`
- Method: `POST`
- Authorization: `Apikey YOUR_SEPAY_API_KEY`

### 4. Deploy Frontend to Vercel

```bash
cd frontend

# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Set environment
vercel env add VITE_API_URL production
# Enter: https://your-backend.up.railway.app/api/v1
```

### 5. Test End-to-End

```bash
# Run verification
./verify-deployment.sh

# Test health check
curl https://your-backend.up.railway.app/api/v1/health

# Monitor logs
railway logs --follow
```

---

## 🛠️ Useful Commands

### View Logs
```bash
railway logs              # Recent logs
railway logs --follow     # Real-time logs
```

### Check Status
```bash
railway status            # Service status
railway variables         # List env variables
railway domain            # Show domain
```

### Manage Service
```bash
railway restart           # Restart service
railway open              # Open in browser
```

### Update Variables
```bash
railway variables set KEY=VALUE
railway variables delete KEY
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed

**Check logs:**
```bash
railway logs
```

**Common issues:**
- Missing environment variables
- Database connection failed
- Build errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify all variables are set
railway variables

# Restart service
railway restart

# Redeploy
cd backend
railway up --detach
```

### Database Issues

**Check DATABASE_URL:**
```bash
railway variables | grep DATABASE_URL
```

**Verify MySQL is running:**
```bash
railway status
```

**Run migrations manually:**
```bash
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### CORS Errors

**Update CORS_ORIGIN:**
```bash
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN="https://your-frontend.vercel.app,https://your-backend.up.railway.app"
```
